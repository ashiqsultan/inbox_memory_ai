InboxMemory AI is like **ChatGPT for your emails**. It's an intelligent email assistant that transforms your inbox into a searchable knowledge base using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology.

### Key Features

- **üìß Email-to-Knowledge**: Forward emails to create a searchable knowledge base
- **ü§ñ Natural Language Q&A**: Ask questions about your emails in plain English
- **‚úâÔ∏è Email Interface**: Query via email or through the web app
- **üîç Smart Search**: AI-powered semantic search through your email content
- **‚ö° Quick Setup**: Just send "Hi [your name]" to `ai@kbhelper.com` to get started

### How It Works

1. **Store**: Forward emails to build your knowledge base - emails are chunked and stored in a vector database
2. **Query**: Ask questions via email or the web app
3. **Get Answers**: AI searches through your saved content and provides intelligent responses
